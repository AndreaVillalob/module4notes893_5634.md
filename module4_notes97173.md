#### Notes: Module 4 AWS Cloud Security

•	Cybersecurity is security that protects the network.

•	Cybersecurity could sometimes be hacked by hackers.

•	AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that services are in AWS Cloud.

•	Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps with secure control access with AWS resources.

•	IAM allows shared access to the AWS accounts.

•	IAM also allows granular permission.

•	IAM allows multi-factor authentication which adds extra security.

Is there a better multi-factor authentication with better security?

Why is Cybersecurity easy to hack in?
